known data association works fine)

# Known issues
Due to the additions -Wextra -Wno-psabi flags, some standard function definitions
like service call, timer call back throw errors due to unused arguments. This can be
fixed by avoiding the Wextra flag. But I chose to keep it within CMakelists since it gave out
other useful warnings
